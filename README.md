This piece of code helps you to deal with the DLT/645 Communication protocol. This Chinese protocol is used to communicate with your electronics using a RS232 or a RS485 serial communication cable.

The challenging part is to familiarize yourself to what your electronics' firmware are responsive. Then, the device answers back with a chunck of code and you can decode and display it on your Form or Console.

Here I wrote this piece of code in C#. You can use C++ Windows Console Application in Visual Studio as well.

Here is a link to outline how DLT645 works. However, it is not as easy as it looks like and a bit scarry! but once you figure out what chunck of information you need to send or receive through the serial you are good to go!
